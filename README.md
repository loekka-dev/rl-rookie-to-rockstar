# Reinforcement Learning: Rookie to Rockstar
----
A course on Reinforcement Learning that starts from the ground up. The course is structured as a series of YouTube videos where we build and train RL agents together, step by step. The Jupyter notebooks developed during the lectures are collected inside the lectures directory. Each lecture also comes with a set of exercises provided in the video description, so you can practice and deepen your understanding as you go. (Over time, this may grow into a more comprehensive and polished resource.)
