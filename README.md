# Reinforcement Learning: Rookie to Rockstar
A course on Reinforcement Learning that starts from the ground up. The course is structured as a series of YouTube videos where we build and train RL agents together, step by step. The Jupyter notebooks developed during the lectures are collected inside the lectures directory. Each lecture also comes with a set of exercises provided in the video description, so you can practice and deepen your understanding as you go. (Over time, this may grow into a more comprehensive and polished resource.)

We implement a one-step MDP, also known as a contextual bandit, applied to banner ad placement. In follow-up videos, we will expand this into full reinforcement learning agents operating in multi-step environments. In this lecture, the focus is on (1) introducing the RL loop of context → action → reward, (2) implementing policy evaluation and simple policy updates, and (3) establishing the overall framework of reinforcement learning that includes exploration, exploitation, and the evaluation of cumulative reward.
